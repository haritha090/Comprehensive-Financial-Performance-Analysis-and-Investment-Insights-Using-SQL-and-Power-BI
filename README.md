# Comprehensive-Financial-Performance-Analysis-and-Investment-Insights-Using-SQL-and-Power-BI
# Aim
To analyze the financial health, profitability, and investment potential of companies by utilizing SQL-based data analysis and Power BI visualizations, enabling data-driven decision-making for strategic investments and risk assessment. 

# Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing key financial metrics of multiple companies to evaluate their overall performance, profitability, and investment potential. Using SQL, essential indicators such as Profit Margin, Debt Ratio, ROI Ranking, and Risk Assessment are calculated and classified into categories like Healthy, Moderate, and Risky based on financial ratios.

The insights derived from SQL queries are then visualized in Power BI, creating an interactive dashboard that highlights:

Company-wise financial performance trends

ROI rankings and risk segmentation

Identification of high-risk companies

Investment potential prediction based on ROI and profitability
